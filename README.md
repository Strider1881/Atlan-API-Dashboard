Atlan API Observability Dashboard

This repository presents a comprehensive observability solution developed for the Atlan Platform Internship Challenge 2025. The project aims to enhance debugging efficiency for Atlan engineers by implementing robust observability strategies that track key metrics, monitor system performance, and provide actionable insights.

📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to improve observability for Atlan's API ecosystem by:

Monitoring critical API performance metrics (response times, error rates, throughput).

Implementing a structured logging strategy to streamline debugging.

Designing a shared dashboard for tracking system health.

Reducing repetitive debugging tasks through automation.

This solution addresses inefficiencies in debugging workflows and enhances response times for identifying and resolving issues.

🛠️ Features

API Performance Metrics

Tracks response times (p50, p90, p99), request rates, and error rates.

Identifies slow endpoints and high-error-rate APIs.

Database Monitoring

Monitors query execution time, throughput, and cache hit/miss ratios.

System Resource Utilization

Tracks CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network latency.

Request Tracing

Follows requests across services to pinpoint bottlenecks.

Error Detection & Alerts

Categorizes errors (e.g., 500 Database Timeout, 503 Service Unavailable) and triggers alerts for abnormal patterns.

📊 Dashboard Preview

This project includes a sample dashboard showcasing real-time metrics:

🖥️ Key Components

Observability Framework: OpenTelemetry

This solution leverages OpenTelemetry to collect metrics, logs, and traces across services. This ensures compatibility with various monitoring tools while providing comprehensive system insights.

Key Metrics Tracked

API Metrics: Response times (p50/p90/p99), request rates, error rates.

Database Metrics: Query execution time, cache hit/miss ratio.

System Metrics: CPU/memory usage, disk I/O.

Logging Strategy

Logs are categorized as follows:

Retained Logs: API request details (method, endpoint, response time), database query logs.

Excluded Logs: Redundant debug logs or repetitive success messages.

Enhanced Logging: Correlation IDs for tracing requests across services.
